\title{ Functions to plot Shewhart g chart }
\description{
  These functions are now in the qcc package so you don't need to load
  TeachingDemos to use them.  They will eventually dissapear from this
  package.

  These functions are used to compute statistics required by the g chart
  (geometric distribution) for use with the qcc package.
}
\usage{
stats.g(data, sizes)
sd.g(data, sizes)
limits.g(center, std.dev, sizes, conf)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{data}{ the observed data values }
  \item{center}{ sample center statistic }
  \item{sizes}{ sample sizes (not used) }
  \item{std.dev}{ standard deviation of geometric distribution }
  \item{conf}{ a numeric value used to compute control limits,
    specifying the number of standard deviations (if 'conf' > 1) or the
    confidence level (if 0 < 'conf' < 1).}
}
\value{
  The function 'stats.g' returns a list with components 'statistics' and
  'center'.

  The function 'sd.g' returns 'std.dev' the standard deviation
  (sqrt(1-p)/p).

  The function 'limits.g' returns a matrix with lower and upper control limits.
}
\details{

  These functions work with the qcc package and may someday be moved
  into the qcc package.

  The g chart plots the number of non-events between events.  np charts
  do not work well when the probability of an event is rare (see example
  below).  Instead of plotting the number of events, the g chart plots
  the number of non-events between events.

\note{ The geometric distribution is quite skewed so it is best to set
  conf at the required confidence interval (0 < conf < 1) rather than as
a multiplier of sigma.}
